::
- Note that I use "repeating research" as a neutral umbrella term
- RR = any research that repeats an earlier study
- RR is related to, but distinct from the other areas
- RR has Several perspectives
- (a) Retrospective: What kind of repetition has been done (replication, reproduction, etc. 
- (b) Prospective: Can the results of a study be repeated (replicability, reproducibility, etc.)


---
### Why does Repeating Research matter?
* Why is it relevant? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
    * Relates to issues of trust and reliability of research
    * Relates to generalizability and robustness of research
* Why is it timely?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
    * Recently, repeatability of research has come to be questioned
    * First in biomedicine and psychology
    * More recently also in ML, NLP and CLS

::
- Basic idea: corroboration of results through multiple studies
- This has proved to be more difficult thatn expected, in: Biomedicine, Biology, Psychology, etc.  (and CLS, recently)
- Traditionally, this has been solved via "authority" (experience, seniority, earlier solid research)
- In the humanities, we have come to replace authority with "intersubjective plausibility", supported by clear argumentation and representative, supporting examples. 
- In CLS, because it works with code and data, this has shifted: 
- (a) Clear argumentation needs to be supplemented by executeable code
- (b) And representative examples are replaced by charts summarizing the results
- Basically, we move from trust, via understanding, to testing
- And this is why RR becomes important in CLS



--
## (2) A Typology of Repeating Research

::
- The "reliability" gap has quickly led to quite confusing terminology, with a range of terms: 
- Replicability, reproducibility, re-analysis, 
- I believe that a first step in a better understanding of repeating research is clear terminology
- Such a terminology should be grounded in a clear understanding of structure of the field


---
#### Dimensions of the typology
* Three (four) key dimensions <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
  * research question
  * method / implementation
  * dataset used
  * (person or team)
* Each dimension can be <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  * identical
  * more or less similar
  * different 

::
- In the sciences, there is often a fourth dimension: same person/team or different person/team conducting the experiment.
- Advantage of a typological and conceptual approach: the labels become secondary (labels are source of confusion)
- Important to me: conceptual typology, with labels that are ultimately exchangeable
- As we will see, each type of RR also provides a specific kind of corroborating evidence for research; 


---
#### Typology (same research question)
<img height="500" data-src="img/replication-typology-a.jpg">

::
- (1) Same data, same method
- Everything has to be available! Code and data
- Does not add new evidence; just checks everything works as it should.
- Sciences: difference between same person (intra-run) or different person/lab (between-run R; with separate stdev associated with each). 
- (2) Same method, new (comparable but different) data
- This adds new evidence: are the results just a chance product of the data or not? Supports generalization. 
- (3) Same data, but new method / implementation of the method
- Also adds new evidence: corroborates findings, shows robustness. 
- A take-away for me when practicing RR has been that exact replication of an experiment is useful, but not terribly exciting; it becomes more interesting, and more of a learning opportunity, when you introduce slight differences; modify code; re-implement the methode; new dataset, etc.


---
#### Typology (different research question)
<img height="500" data-src="img/replication-typology-b.jpg">

::
- We'll skip this today. 
- The relationship between earlier and later study is necessarily looser, here. 
- Less controversial, because the results don't need to be similar.

## (3) Affordances of the Typology

---
### Affordances
* Structure <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
    * Structures the field of RR
    * Systematic relations between kinds of RR
* Terminology <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
    * Conceptual typology first, labels second
    * Terms have relational, differentiated meaning
    * Supports translating terminology between communities
* Practice <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
    * What needs to be provided to enable specific type of RR?
    * Clarity on what to expect from a given RR study
    * Helps identify similar studies across disciplines
* Strategy <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
    * Helps establish RR as part of CLS


--
## Conclusion

---
### Conclusion
* Who is concerned by RR? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
    * An individual effort: routinely make code and data available
    * A community effort: organize, together, a continual replication process
* How to support RR? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
    * Help make papers repeatable: Establish reporting standards for RR
    * Support practice of RR: Establish a RR publication category
    * Create incentives for RR: e.g. best RR paper award
