- Note that I use "repeating research" as a neutral umbrella term
- RR = any research that repeats an earlier study

::
- RR is related to, but distinct from the other areas
- RR has Several perspectives
- (a) Retrospective: What kind of repetition has been done (replication, reproduction, etc. 
- (b) Prospective: Can the results of a study be repeated (replicability, reproducibility, etc.)

### Why does Repeating Research matter?
* Why is it relevant? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
    * Relates to issues of trust and reliability of research
    * Relates to generalizability and robustness of research
* Why is it timely?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
    * Recently, repeatability of research has come to be questioned
    * First in biomedicine and psychology
    * More recently also in ML, NLP and DH

::
- Basic idea: corroboration of results through multiple studies
- This has proved to be more difficult than expected, in: Biomedicine, Biology, Psychology, etc.  (and CLS, recently)
- In the humanities, we usually use "intersubjective plausibility", supported by clear argumentation and representative, supporting examples. 
- In Digital Humanities, because it works with code and data, this has shifted: 
- (a) Clear argumentation needs to be supplemented by executeable code
- (b) And representative examples are replaced by charts summarizing the results
- This is why RR now becomes important also in DH



--
## (2) A Typology of Repeating Research

::
- The terminology is actually quite confusing, with a range of terms: 
- Replicability, reproducibility, re-analysis, 
- I believe that a first step in a better understanding of repeating research is clear terminology
- Such a terminology should be grounded in a clear understanding of the conceptual structure of the problem
- Advantage of a typological and conceptual approach: the labels become secondary (labels are source of confusion)
- Important to me: conceptual typology, with labels that are ultimately exchangeable


---
#### A 3-dimensional concept space
<img height="500" data-src="img/trr-cube.jpg">

::
- Three (four) key dimensions
  - research question
  - method (sometimes distinct: implementation)
  - dataset used
  - In the sciences, there is sometimes a 4th dimensions: person / team / lab
- Each dimension can be identical, more or less similar, different 


---
#### Typology (same research question)
<img height="500" data-src="img/replication-typology-a.jpg">


---
### Same method, same data
- Proposed term: replication (of the experiment)
- Function: quality check
- New knowledge: little
- Requirements: very high<br/>(code and data need to be available)

---
### Same method, different data
- Proposed term: reproduction (of the results)
- Function: check generalizability of method
- New knowledge: yes, supports generalization
- Requirements: high<br/>(code needs to be available)


---
### Different method, same data
- Proposed term: re-analysis (of the data)
- Function: check robustness of results
- New knowledge: yes, shows robustness
- Requirements: high<br/>(data needs to be available)



---
#### Typology (different research question)
<img height="500" data-src="img/replication-typology-b.jpg">

::
- We'll skip this today. 
- The relationship between earlier and later study is necessarily looser, here. 
- Less controversial, because the results don't need to be similar.

## Examples

### Example from CLS: Mendenhall
<img height="200" data-src="img/epistemologica_Mendenhall-1918-Wikipedia.jpg"> <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
<img height="200" data-src="img/epistemologica_mendenhall-oliver-twist.png"> <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
<br/><img height="200" data-src="img/epistemologica_twist-full.png"> <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
<img height="200" data-src="img/epistemologica_twist-1000.png"> <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
<p><small>Stéfan Sinclair and Geoffrey Rockwell: Epistemologica, 2015-2019, <a href="https://github.com/sgsinclair/epistemologica/">https://github.com/sgsinclair/epistemologica/</a>, repeating T. C. Mendenhall's "The Characteristic Curves of Composition" (1887). </small></p>


::
- A take-away for me when practicing RR has been that exact replication of an experiment is useful, but not terribly exciting; it becomes more interesting, and more of a learning opportunity, when you introduce slight differences; modify code; re-implement the methode; new dataset, etc.

---
### Example from CLS: Spitzer
<a href="img/signifikanz.svg"><img height="500" data-src="img/signifikanz.svg"></a>
<br/><small>Schöch (2021) repeating Spitzer (1928) on Racine (17th-century)</small>

::
- Again, typical of CLS repeating research: analog/digital divide
- Here, several types of repeating research combined
- Starts out as relatively strictly reproducing research (but across the digital divide)
- Then the dataset is changed (larger dataset, comparison authors)
- Then the methods are changed as well: exploratory instead of "search"-based

## Conclusion

---
### Affordances of the Typology
* Structure <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
    * Structures the field of RR
    * Systematic relations between kinds of RR
* Terminology <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
    * Conceptual typology first, labels second
    * Terms have relational, differentiated meaning
    * Helps check the meaning of a term in use
    * Supports translating terminology between communities
* Practice <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
    * What needs to be provided to enable specific type of RR?
    * Clarity on what to expect from a given RR study
    * Helps identify similar studies across disciplines



---
### A way forward for DH/CLS?
* Strategy <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
    * Typology helps establish RR as part of DH
    * Shows how essential Open Science is!
* Who is concerned by RR? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
    * An individual effort: routinely make code and data available
    * A community effort: organize a joint, continual replication process
* How to support RR? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
    * Help make papers repeatable: Establish reporting standards for RR
    * Support practice of RR: Establish a RR publication category
    * Create incentives for RR: e.g. best RR paper award
